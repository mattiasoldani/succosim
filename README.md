# succosim

This is **succosim**, a [Geant4](http://www.geant4.org/geant4/) blank template meant to be used at a starting point to create beamtest software simulations. It has been developed with a focus on the typical experimental configurations of the INSULAb group beamtests &mdash; see, for example, [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/731649/contributions/3237202/) and [here](http://cds.cern.ch/record/2672249).
